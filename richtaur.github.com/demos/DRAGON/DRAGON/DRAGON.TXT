I live in the little shitty town of   
Carterville Illinois and have only one
other friend who programs: Jim        
MacDonald - who is the coolest        
programmer on Earth. I don't care what
you say.                              
-                                    -
The setup for this is really bad I    
know... but shut up this is just me by
myself making a bunch of crap. I have 
been trying to program with Turbo C++ 
for quite some time, but it's too     
damned technical and the only way to  
get Mode 13h with 3.0 is to write to  
the Video Buffer - which is a bitch!  
-                                    -
The thing is I've been programming    
with QB for about a year and I hadn't 
had a compiler...that's one reason C++
attracted me.  Bad thing about QB is  
it can only have 64K worth of arrays, 
which means I had to take out all of  
the .VOC files I had in store for it. 
It WAS really cool, but at least I    
was able to include some regular SB   
sound instead of crappy PC sound.     
-                                    -
Anyway anyone who wants to contact    
somebody making QB games, you can do  
so at http\\*********.                
-                                    -
Oh yes!  If somebody wants to tell me 
how to play MIDI tunes in QB or C     
PLEASE contact me!!
